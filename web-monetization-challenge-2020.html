		<h4>Web Monetization</h4>
		<p><a href="https://webmonetization.org/" target='_blank'>Web Monetization</a> is an open technology that allows someone viewing a webpage or playing a web game to stream very small payments (micropayments) to the creator in real time. It is an exciting new and non-intrusive way for game developers to monetize their web games while at the same time offering premium content to their paying players.</p>

		<p>Web Monetization is being <a href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-web-monetization-a-new-revenue-model-for-the-web/3785" target='_blank'>proposed as a W3C standard</a>. It is based on the <a href="https://interledger.org/" target='_blank'>Interledger</a> protocol which is an open, neutral protocol for transferring money of any currency, including digital currencies such as Bitcoin.</p>
