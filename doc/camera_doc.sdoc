<p>Several cameras can be active at the same time, but only the camera that was last activated will be used for rendering.
When the camera is deactivated (see <code>release_camera_focus</code>), the previously activated camera will again be used for rendering automatically.</p>
<p>The reason it is called "camera focus" is the similarity to how acquiring input focus works (see <code>acquire_input_focus</code>).</p>:Í<p>In the examples, it is assumed that the instance of the script has a camera-component with id "camera".</p>

Post this message to a camera-component to deactivate it. The camera is then removed from the active cameras.
See <code>acquire_camera_focus</code> for more information how the active cameras are used in rendering.
