Features
Defold is a turn-key solution, providing everything you need to build a game.

Animation
Flip book animations for sprites, GUI nodes and particles
Spine bone animations with full support for blending
Keyframe events
Inverse kinematics in keyframes and dynamically scriptable
All sprite and GUI properties can be animated
Predefined or custom easing functions for all property animation
Cross-platform
One click deployment to 6 target platforms (iOS, Android, HTML5, OS X, Windows, Linux) from the same code and content
Editor and tools running on Mac OS X (10.7 Lion or later), Windows 7 and later, Linux (Ubuntu LTS and Debian 7 has been verified to work)
Optimization
Small engine overhead (currently about 5Mb but the goal is to cut that down considerably)
Fast build times. All build targets, even HTML5, are completed in seconds
Static content dependencies gives automatic resource management. Only used assets are included in game builds
Sprite packing to atlases
Per platform configurable texture compression
Dynamic batching in the render pipeline
Asynchronous (or synchronous) loading of asset data
Graphics
Fully scriptable rendering pipeline with low level access
Custom materials and shaders
Particle effects editor with live previewing of emitter and modifier behavior
Curve editor for controlling particle parameter changes over particle lifespan
Tile editor for building 2D level geometry
GUI editor
Layered GUI with text, images and pie nodes
GUI clipping/stencil masks
GUI image nodes support slice-9 texturing
Automatic GUI layout and support for orientation changes
Bitmap and distance field fonts
Truetype, Opentype and BMFont supported
Physics
2D and 3D physics (Box 2D and Bullet) fully integrated
Shape based collision detection
Precise collision detection for tilemaps
Static, dynamic and kinematic (scriptable) physics objects
Robust triggers
Audio
Ogg and Wav sound support
