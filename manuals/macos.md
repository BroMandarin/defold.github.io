# macOS development

Developing Defold applications for the macOS platform is a straight forward process with very few considerations to make.

## Project settings

macOS specific application configuration is done from the [OSX section](/manuals/project-settings/#osx) of the *game.project* settings file.

## Application icon

The application icon used for a macOS game must be in the .icns format. You can easily create a .icns file from a set of .png files collected as an iconset. Follow the [official instructions for creating a .icns file](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/HighResolutionOSX/Optimizing/Optimizing.html). Brief summary of the steps involved are:

1. Create an iconset folder, eg `foobar.iconset`
2. Copy icon files to the created folder:

    * `icon_16x16.png`
    * `icon_16x16@2x.png`
    * `icon_32x32.png`
    * `icon_32x32@2x.png`
    * `icon_128x128.png`
    * `icon_128x128@2x.png`
    * `icon_256x256.png`
    * `icon_256x256@2x.png`
    * `icon_512x512.png`
    * `icon_512x512@2x.png`

3. Convert the .iconset folder to a .icns file using the `iconutil` command line tool:

```
iconutil -c icns -o foobar.icns foobar.iconset
```

## Signing and notarizing your game

Apple requires all software distributed outside the Mac App Store to be notarized by Apple in order to run by default on macOS Catalina. Refer to the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution/customizing_the_notarization_workflow) to learn how to add notarization to a scripted build environment outside of XCode. Brief summary of the steps involved are:

1. Sign your game using `codesign`:

```
$ codesign --force --sign "Developer ID Application: Company Name" --options runtime --deep --timestamp Foobar.app
```

2. Zip and upload your game for notarization using `altool`.

```
$ xcrun altool --notarize-app
               --primary-bundle-id "com.acme.foobar"
               --username "AC_USERNAME"
               --password "@keychain:AC_PASSWORD"
               --asc-provider <ProviderShortname>
               --file Foobar.zip

altool[16765:378423] No errors uploading 'Foobar.zip'.
RequestUUID = 2EFE2717-52EF-43A5-96DC-0797E4CA1041
```

3. Check the status of your submission using the returned request UUID from the call to `altool --notarize-app`:

```
$ xcrun altool --notarization-info 2EFE2717-52EF-43A5-96DC-0797E4CA1041
               -u "AC_USERNAME"
```

4. Wait until the status becomes `success` and staple the notarization ticket to the game:

```
$ xcrun stapler staple "Foobar.app"
```
