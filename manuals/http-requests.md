brief: This manual explains how to make HTTP requests.

## HTTP requests

Defold can make normal HTTP requests using the `http.request()` function. Example:

```Lua
local function handle_response(self, id, response)
	print(response.status, response.response)
end

http.request("https://www.defold.com", "GET", handle_response)
```

This will make an HTTP GET request to https://www.defold.com. The function is asynchronous and will not block while making the request. Once the request has been made and a server has sent a response it will invoke/call the provided callback function. The callback function will receive the full server response, including status code and response headers.

It is also possible to make HTTP POST requests to pass data to the server and to specify request headers:

```Lua
local function handle_response(self, id, response)
	print(response.status, response.response)
end

local headers = {
	["Content-Type"] = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
}
local body = "foo=bar"
http.request("https://httpbin.org/post", "POST", handle_response, headers, body)
```

Refer to the [API reference](/ref/http/) to learn more.

HTTP requests are automatically cached in the client to improve network performance. The cached files are stored in an OS specific application support path in a folder named `defold/http-cache`. You usually don't have to care about the HTTP cache but if you need to clear the cache during development you can manually delete the folder containing the cached files. On macOS this folder is located in `%HOME%/Library/Application Support/Defold/http-cache/` and on Windows in `%APP_DATA%/defold/http-cache`.
