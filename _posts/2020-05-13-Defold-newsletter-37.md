## Monetization
### Grant for the Web first public Call for Proposals
Grant for the Web, a collaborative partnership between Mozilla, Creative Commons, and Coil, was launched to champion a web that provides openness and opportunity for everyone.

With $100 million to distribute globally over five years, this initial public Call for Proposals will fund projects that contribute to an ecosystem of web monetized content. If you have an idea that explores the use of web monetization in a Defold game (or otherwise!) you should definitely take a look.
