We recently hosted a game jam as part of [the grant we received from Grant for the Web](https://defold.com/2020/06/09/Defold-is-awarded-a-grant-from-Grant-for-the-Web/). The game jam was [hosted on itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/the-web-monetization-challenge-2020) and ran for the entire month of November.

The goal of the game jam was to create a game which uses Web Monetization in interesting ways and incorporates the theme "Secrets" into the game design. You can [read more about the game jam here](https://defold.com/web-monetization-challenge-2020/).
