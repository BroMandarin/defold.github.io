The forum (forum.defold.com), build (build.defold.com) and download (d.defold.com) servers became temporarily unavailable on Friday the 28th of February due to an expired SSL certificate. The certificate was renewed well ahead of the expiration date but due to human error the new certificate was not installed on the servers, causing secure connections to fail. The renewed certificate will be installed on Monday the 2nd of March. We expect everything to be operational again as soon as the installation has been completed.

If you urgently need access to the unavailable systems you can adjust your system time and date to before the 28th of February.

We apologies for this inconvenience and we will take measures to prevent this from happening again.
