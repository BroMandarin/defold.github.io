## Some notes on the categories
In both People's Choice and Yandex' Choice the rankings are based purely on analytics data gathered during the period after the jam:

* In People's Choice the ranking is based on user rating in a five star system. The top 10 games all scored high and it was very close between several of the games.
* In the Yandex' Choice category the rankings are based on analytics data such as retention, average time in  game, total time and several other factors.

In the Defold's Choice category we've given the games an unbiased rating based on theme, technical excellence and fun.
