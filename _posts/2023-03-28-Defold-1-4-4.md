## Engine
__BREAKING CHANGE__: ([#7431](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7431)) __Refactor textures as resource__ 
As a first step in representing textures as actual handles that can be passed around between the render scripts and the rest of the engine, we need to separate between the actual texture handles and the resources that hold them. A HTexture is currently a pointer to the asset created by the graphics adapter which is then stored in the resource system. Instead, a wrapper around the graphics handle is stored, which means that we can change the way we represent the handle.

Technical note: This is a breaking change in the public dmSDK part of the engine. Several resources now store TextureResource pointers instead of the HTexture objects, and any native extension that use these APIs will have to update their code to make sure the types are correct.

__NEW__: ([#7457](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7457)) __Show `self` values in debugger for `*.render_script`, `*.script` and `*.gui_script`__ 
Show values from `self` table in debuggerfor `*.render_script`, `*.script` and `*.gui_script` .

__NEW__: ([#7413](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7413)) __Improved gamepad support for the Windows platform__ 
Added support for various controllers on the Windows platform by implementing a Direct Input layer that can support a wider range of devices natively. This means that you no longer need to use a translation layer between XInput and Direct Input via external tools such as DS4Windows to be able to use gamepads with Defold.

__NEW__: ([#6845](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/6845)) __Paged texture atlas support__ 
Added support for generating atlases with multiple pages of texture data. Enable this feature by setting the max page size value in the atlas files to non-zero. To use the paged atlas in the materials, the material shaders require a "sampler2DArray" uniform in order to sample from the texture.

__NEW__: ([#7378](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7378)) __Added frustum culling support for model component__ 


__NEW__: ([#7415](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7415)) __Added go.exists()__ 
Added a `go.exists()` function to check if a game object exists. Usage:

```
if go.exists("/my_game_object") then
    print("The game object exists!")
end
```

__FIX__: ([#7437](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7437)) __Fix bug when some of embeded GOs maybe ignored by component counter__ 
In a case when embedded GOs in a few different collections are the same, component counter didn't count the second and the following GOs.

__FIX__: ([#7429](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7429)) __Removed duplicate Size property on Gui Text objects__ 
Gui Text nodes no longer show two Size properties.

__FIX__: ([#7353](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7353)) __Fixed index buffer lookup in headless graphics backend__ 
This fixes a buffer overrun issue when using index buffers with the headless graphics backend.

__FIX__: ([#7406](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7406)) __Use locale-insensitive conversion from lower to upper case in bob__ 
This fixes an issue when using the bob command line tool to bundle a Defold project on an operating system with a locale which is does not have a standard lower to upper case mapping, such as Turkish (where a lower case i becomes İ, ie a capital I with a dot).

__FIX__: ([#7400](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7400)) __Show an error message when an added collection file is missing__ 
Show a better error message when a collection file which has been added to a collection does not exist. Previously a NullPointerException error was shown with no reference to the missing file.

__FIX__: ([#7444](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7444)) __Updated sprite size property documentation__ 
The sprite size property was marked as read-only even though it is possible to change the size of a sprite if the size-mode is set to manual.

__FIX__: ([#7395](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7395)) __Improve error message when Android build is too large__ 
It is not possible to create an APK larger than 2Gb using the Android bundletool, but the error message when bundling a very large APK using the command line tools or editor is not very informative. This fix detects the case when the APK is too large and outputs additional information in the error message.

__FIX__: ([#7401](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7401)) __URL decode Bob resource path before attempting file operations__ 
Bob now URL decodes the file:// URL that references the Bob jar file before attempting file operations.

__FIX__: ([#7446](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7446)) __Bugfix for using basis transcoding since paged atlas feature__ 
Fixed an issue with using basis compression together with cubemap generation, where the output of the texture encoding produced an empty result. To fix this issue, we have separated the transcoding into two passes - a preprocessing pass for memory allocation of the result, and one to do the actual transcoding.

__FIX__: ([#7430](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7430)) __Produce uv bounds for dynamic atlases__ 
Added support for using dynamic atlases in GUI.

__FIX__: ([#7452](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7452) __Updated build toolchain with XCode 14.2, macOS 13.1 and iOS 16.2__
We've updated our toolchain to support latest XCode plus macOS and iOS sdks.

## Editor
__FIX__: ([#7410](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7410)) __Some font glyphs are not rendering correctly__ 
Small glyphs, such as the dot (.) character, are not rendered correctly when the uncompressed size of the glyph is smaller than the compressed size. When this happens the first byte of the glyph is ignored and the glyph is rendered skewed or shifted one pixel in the font texture.

__FIX__: ([#7388](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7388)) __Identical names require the same values in templates__ 
User-facing changes: when multiple templates used in the same GUI define resources with clashing names, we now require them to refer to the same values. For instance, suppose a GUI file named `A.gui` contains two templates: `B.gui` and `C.gui`. If both templates define a font named "main_font" and the actual fonts used in each template are not the same, `A.gui` will not know which one to use and will randomly choose one. To prevent this issue, we will now display a build error when such clashes occur.

__FIX__: ([#7419](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7419)) __Set resource name based on filename__ 
A common source of problems when working with collection proxies is the fact that all collections are given the name "default", and if you are not careful and remember to change this name you will run into issues such as `The collection ‘default’ could not be created since there is already a socket with the same name.`. This change will give a created Collection, Material, or Model resources the same name as the filename.

__FIX__: ([#7435](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7435)) __Add support for external buffers from the .gltf/.glb formats__ 


__FIX__: ([#7396](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7396)) __Validate Android package name and iOS bundle identifier__ 
An Android package name and Apple bundle identifier follows strict rules, but there are no checks in place to verify that the package name and bundle identifiers in `game.project` actually follow the rules. This fix adds a check when bundling for Android, iOS and macOS that these values follow their respective formats.

**Android**: Must consist of two or more segments separated by a dot. Each segment must start with a letter. Each segment must only consist of alphanumeric letters or the underscore character.

**iOS and macOS**: Must consist of two or more segments separated by a dot. Each segment must start with a letter. Each segment must only consist of alphanumeric letters, the underscore or hypen (-) character.

__FIX__: ([#7451](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7451)) __Update JavaFX (Fix issue with freezes when using AMD GPUs on Linux system)__ 
JavaFX updates to the latest at the moment 19.0.2.1 version. It will help with stability and performance, especially on Linux.
