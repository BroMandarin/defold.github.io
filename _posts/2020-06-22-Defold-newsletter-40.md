Hello, Defolder! ðŸ‘‹

Things have slowed down somewhat since the very busy launch of the Defold Foundation but we still have some exciting things to share!

## Games
### Zoo Economy
Zoo economy is a strategy-puzzle game where you exchange animals. Animals are your currency. Complete historic based story missions or play in a sandbox. Get animals, breed them, attract visitors, sponsor expeditions for unique animals, upgrade your zoo and much more. [LEARN MORE](https://forum.defold.com/t/zoo-economy-strategy-puzzle/65466)

## The Defold Foundation is awarded a grant from Grant for the Web
The Defold Foundation has been awarded a grant from Grant for the Web to explore the use of Web Monetization in games. The Defold Foundation will use the grant to integrate, promote and support the use of Web Monetization in web games created using Defold. The Defold Foundation will integrate Web Monetization through its plugin system, promote it through examples and tutorials and host a game jam focused on Web Monetization.
