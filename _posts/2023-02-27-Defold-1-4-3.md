## Engine
__CHANGE__: ([#7240](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7240)) __Update NDK 25 LTS (r25b)__ 
Defold updated from NDK r20 to NDK r25b - the latesNDK version at the moment.
**Now minimum Android version API is 19 (Android 4.4)**

__NEW__: ([#7264](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7264)) __Factory dynamic prototype__ 
We've added the possibility to change the prototype of a `collectionfactory` / `factory` component at runtime.
This allows the developer to load and spawn an arbitrary `.collectionc`/`.goc` file, further simplifying using dynamic content. The `.collectionc`/.goc` files still need to be part of the resource archive.
Doc: [collectionfactory.set_prototype()](https://defold.com/ref/stable/collectionfactory/#collectionfactory.set_prototype:[url]-[prototype]) / [factory.set_prototype()](https://defold.com/ref/stable/factory/#factory.set_prototype:[url]-[prototype])

We've added a "Dynamic Prototype" checkbox to the factories. The prototype can only be overridden when this is checked. If set, then the collection component count cannot be optimized, and the owning collection will use the default component counts from game.project.

__NEW__: ([#7029](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7029)) __Add timer.get_info() function__ 
Sometimes it is needed to get additional information about a running timer, for instance the remaining time before it fires. This change adds a `timer.get_info(handle)` method which returns a table with information about a timer. Example:

```
local handle = timer.delay(2, true, function() end)

--after 0.5 seconds we call:

local info = timer.get_info(handle)
print(info.time_remaining) -- 1.5
print(info.delay)     -- 2
print(info.repeating) -- true
```

If timer cancelled or completed the function will return nil.

__NEW__: ([#7266](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7266)) __Update Android SDK (33.0.1 - Android 13 - API 33)__ 
Android SDK updated to version 33.0.1
Android target API updated to API level 33 (Android 13).

__NEW__: ([#7296](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7296)) __Document ports and services__ 
The engine ports and services are now documented in engine/docs/DEBUG_PORTS_AND_SERVICES.md.

__NEW__: ([#6902](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/6902)) __Shader include support__ 
Added support for *#include* pragmas in shader files. This feature can be used to separate shader functions into modules that can be used across several shader files, which should help out with reusing code from your own project, or from asset extensions.

__NEW__: ([#7329](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7329)) __Update Screen Orientation options by Default on iOS and Android__ 
Use `userLandscape`, `userPortrait` and `fullUser` for `android:screenOrientation` on Android ([read more](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#screen)). Use both `UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait` + `UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown` for portrait on iOS and `UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft` +`UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight` for Landscape ([read more](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/uisupportedinterfaceorientations)).

__NEW__: ([#7214](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7214)) __Create buffer in runtime__ 
Added new function _resource.create_buffer_ to create buffer resources dynamically in runtime. The function takes a buffer object created by other buffer resources, from the C api or via the lua _buffer.create_ function.

__FIX__: ([#7315](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7315)) __Fix issue with components counter for cached resources__ 
Now Bob considers changes in a linked GameObject when deciding to take a collection from the cache or rebuild it.

__FIX__: ([#7337](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/7337)) __Uploading empty index buffer on WebGL is very slow__ 
When updating an empty index buffer, it took 90ms in my case.

__FIX__: ([#7320](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7320)) __Fix issue when OGG file added to GO without component doesn't work in bundle__ 
Now bob converts ogg component (resource based component) into sound component when building.

__FIX__: ([#7343](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7343)) __Show error in bob when referencing missing script resource properties__ 
Bob now reports an error for missing script resource properties.

__FIX__: ([#7355](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7355)) __Fix missing emitter fields of Initial Stretch X and Initial Stretch Y and Initial Angular Velocity for multiple emitters__ 
Adds emitter fields of `Initial Stretch X` and `Initial Stretch Y` and `Initial Angular Velocity` to emitters that added after a particle effects that use more then one emitter. Previously these fields were missing from `template.emitter` which caused these fields to be greyed out for particle effects that used more than one emitter. Also clicking on those fields and adding a value causes an error `java.lang.NullPointerException: Unknown`.

__FIX__: ([#7359](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7359)) __Moved dmProfile::HProfile/BeginFrame/EndFrame to the dmsdk for easier substitution__ 
This change allows for easier custom implementation of the profiling data in an extension.

__FIX__: ([#7370](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7370)) __Fixed issue with model vertex color in rgb format__ 
This fixes an issue when importing vertex colors in 3-tuples. We convert it into 4-tuples, with `alpha=1.0f`.
It is now also possible to avoid setting any textures at all in case your model doesn't need them.

__FIX__: ([#7336](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7336)) __Use min x and y scale for particle effect scale in gui__
The [previous fix](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7336#7163) for particle effect scale only partially solved the problem of inconsistent particle effects scaling between gui and game objects. The original issue was that the x component of the scale was always used when scaling in the gui. The partial fix applied in [#7163](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/7163) used the smallest scale component of x, y and z, which made particle effect scaling in gui more consistent. The problem is that on window resize only the x and y component of the scale of a gui node is affected while the z component remains at its original value, which would produce an incorrect result for particle effects.

The correct solution, which is applied in this fix is to use the smallest of the x and y component when applying a scale to particle effects in gui. This is consistent with how other nodes are scaled and it is also consistent with how particle effects on game objects are scaled using smallest uniform scale value (using x, y, z in 3d/go and only x and y in 2d/gui).


## Editor
__FIX__: ([#7312](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7312)) __Improve GUI modification performance__ 
This improves the editing performance of highly-referenced GUI files by around 25% (reduces the number of successors in a real-world project from 200k to 150k).

__FIX__: ([#7325](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7325)) __Fix Dependencies and Referencing Files popup showing blank entries for some resource types__ 
Fix Dependencies and Referencing Files popup showing blank entries for some resource types

__FIX__: ([#7350](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7350)) __Fail the build on invalid requires__ 
The editor will now fail the build if a script file requires an existing lua module, but starts the `require` argument string with a slash.

__FIX__: ([#7363](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7363)) __Removed license header from debugger bootstrap script__ 
The Defold license was accidentally applied to the debugger bootstrap script which made the script too large to send as a message when attaching the debugger.

__FIX__: ([#7389](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/7389)) __Fixed issue when calculating convex hull for atlas images__
The hull calculation was incorrect and produced overlapping triangles.
