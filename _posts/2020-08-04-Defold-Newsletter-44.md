In the Creator Spotlight posts we invite Defold users to present themselves and share a bit of their background, their work and things that inspire them.

In this second edition of the Creator Spotlight we invited Niclas (aka Totebo), the creator of Juump!, Rainbow Pop, Monkey Kick and several others, to tell us a little bit about himself and his current project
