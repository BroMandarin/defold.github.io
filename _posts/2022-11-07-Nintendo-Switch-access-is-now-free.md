_The Defold Foundation will no longer charge a monthly fee for access to the Nintendo Switch build tools and game engine plugin._

STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN - Nov. 7, 2022 - The Defold Foundation today announced the decision to no longer charge a monthly fee for access to the Nintendo Switch build tools and game engine plugin. Approved Nintendo Switch developers can now request access to Defold through the Nintendo Developer Portal and will upon verification receive access to the required tools and documentation. Full source code access to the Nintendo Switch specific core of the Defold engine will still only be available as a separate paid membership tier. Note that full source code access is not necessary to release games made with Defold on the Nintendo eShop.

"We're really pleased to be able to offer Nintendo Switch access for free to all verified developers. This change also aligns perfectly with the foundation's overarching goal of making Defold available for free to developers world wide.", said Björn Ritzl, the Defold Foundation Chairperson.
