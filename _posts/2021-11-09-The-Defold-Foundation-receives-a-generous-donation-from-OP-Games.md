STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN - Nov. 9, 2021 - The Defold Foundation today announced that it has received a generous donation from OP Games to fund development of the Defold game engine. The donation was raised by OP Games through the Arcadians community of gamers and collectors.

“We are humbled by the very generous donations from OP Games. We very much support and agree with OP Games vision of a decentralised web where game developers are able to fund and create games using open source technologies and build communities of players free of traditional gatekeepers,” said Defold Product Owner Björn Ritzl.

The donation will be used to fund general development of the Defold engine, as well as specific experiments within the Web3 space, in particular around applications of blockchain technology in games.

“We are truly honored to be able to support Defold with the funds raised by our Arcadians community! Defold is the perfect example of a public good: it's free and open-source, and doesn't force game developers to monetize through ads or in-app purchases. We hope that this donation will inspire others to support more open-source projects, as they will be foundational in how we break free from the attention economy”, said OP Games CTO and co-founder Paul Gadi.
