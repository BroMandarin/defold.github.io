## Creator Spotlight: Alex
In the Creator Spotlight posts we invite Defold users to present themselves and share a bit of their background, their work and things that inspire them. In the first ever Creator Spotlight we invited Alex (aka Topbraj), the creator of Fates of Ort, to tell us a little bit about himself and his current project.

## #MadeWithDefold Jam

The #MadeWithDefold jam is running from July 18 to July 31. The jam is a community driven initiative by forum user Pawel Jarosz (thank you Pawel!). There are several prices for the winner and runner-ups and since the jam just started there's still time to join and create something cool!
