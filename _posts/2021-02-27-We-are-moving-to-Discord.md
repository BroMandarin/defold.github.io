## We are moving to Discord!
We have decided to move the Defold community from Slack to Discord. This will bring more Defold developers together and also bring our community closer to many other game development communities already present on Discord. The existing Defold Slack workspace will be shut down on April 1st (no joke!), giving you plenty of time to move to Discord.

The Defold community on Discord is a great way to stay in touch with fellow Defold developers, artists and amazing creators. You can discuss game development, get feedback and find beta testers for your game, ask for help when you are stuck or find someone to collaborate with on your next game.
