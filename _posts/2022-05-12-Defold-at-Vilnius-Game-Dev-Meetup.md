The [Lithuanian Game Developers Association](https://www.lzka.lt/) (LŽKA) is a non-profit organization uniting Lithuanian game developers, representing the interests of the industry, promoting the professional development of game developers, mutual cooperation and promoting game development in Lithuania.

A while back we were invited by Melsoft to attend the LŽKA meetup in Vilnius and do a talk about Defold. After two years of Covid pandemic isolation this was an opportunity too good to pass up! We had a great time at the meetup and LŽKA recently published the recording from the presentation [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J15c9dpxHGM) for you to enjoy.
