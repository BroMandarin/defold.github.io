## Release notes

### Engine

__NEW__: ([#6048](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6048)) __Build time measurements and json/html report__ 
Generates new build report that provides information about build time for each stage of the building process.
It uses the same `build-report` arguments for the bob.jar tool but adds `_time` postfix to the provided file name. 


__NEW__: ([#6488](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6488)) __Sign App Extensions when bundling for iOS__ 
An App Extension lets you extend custom functionality and content beyond your app and make it available to users while they’re interacting with other apps or the system. Examples are app specific stickers in iMessage or extensions to the sharing dialog.

App Extensions must be included in the PlugIns folder and they must be signed. It is easy to include extensions in a `PlugIns` folder by adding the `PlugIns` folder as a [bundle resource](https://defold.com/manuals/project-settings/#bundle-resources) to be included in the application bundle.

This change automatically signs any files in `PlugIns` with the `.appex` file extension when the application is bundled.


__NEW__: ([#6492](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6492)) __Cancel all property animations on a game object in a single call__ 
It is now possible to cancel all property animations on a game object by calling `go.cancel_animations(url)` without providing a property as the second argument.



__NEW__: ([#5630](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/5630)) __Add "-keypass" parameter to allow a different key password__ 
This permits a key password to be passed to Bob for signing Android builds, in addition to the keystore password.

```
java -jar bob.jar --key-pass=mykeypass.txt --platform=armv7-android bundle
```


__NEW__: ([#6534](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6534)) __Add option to skip verification of resource archives__ 
A call to `resource.store_archive` will trigger a verification process of the files in the archive. If the archive is large, contains many files and/or the target is a low end phone then the verification process can take way too long. This pull request allows developers to pass an arguments to skip verification:

```
local options = {}
options.verify = false
resource.store_archive(path, cb, options)
```


__FIX__: ([#6567](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6567)) __Removed game.project maximum field size of 2048 bytes__ 
The maximum length of a game.project value was previously hardcoded to 2048 characters. This is more than enough for most values, but when it comes to something like the bundle or custom resources which expects a comma separated list of paths it may not be enough and a long list of paths will cause the parser to fail when loading the game.project file. This change dynamically allocates a buffer large enough to hold the value.


__FIX__: ([#6566](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6566)) __Fixed issue when using fixed update function and time scale 0__ 
This is a fix for a recently introduced issue when using a fixed update and the timestep of a collection proxy was set to 0.


__FIX__: ([#6448](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6448)) __Option to use chunked transfer encoding for HTTPS post data larger than 16kb__ 
When using HTTP POST requests to send large amounts of data to a server over https it may be required to use a Chunked Transfer-Encoding header since some web servers have a max TLS record size of 16kb. The default behaviour in Defold is to use chunked transfer encoding for all https requests with post data larger than 16kb. This is however problematic since some servers do not support chunked transfer encoding. To solve this we have now added a new option to the `http.request()` option table to toggle use of chunked transfer encoding:

```
local options = {
    chunked_transfer = false -- disable chunked transfer encoding
}
http.request(url, method, callback, headers, post_data, options)
```


__FIX__: ([#6578](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/6578)) __Force 3D physics body activation to wake it up__ 
This fixes an issue where `physics.wakeup(url)` didn't wake up dynamic 3D physics bodies.


__FIX__: ([#6518](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6518)) __Fix for out of bounds assert when rendering uninitialized render entries__ 
This fixes a render related crash which may happen if sprites are disabled in the `init()` lifecycle function.


__FIX__: ([#6502](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6502)) __Add missing key bindings to HTML5 builds__ 
In HTML5 builds some keys on a standard keyboard did not have any corresponding mappings to key bindings. Examples of keys missing a binding is the key between left shift and Z or the two keys between 0 and Backspace. This fix adds support for the missing keys.


### Editor
__FIX__: ([#6652](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6652)) __Catch all exceptions while reading custom keymap__ 
If a custom keymap contains invalid edn, a runtime exception is thrown and the editor stops loading. We now catch these exceptions so the editor continues to work.


__FIX__: ([#6475](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6475)) __Set layout node names from display profiles__ 
This fixes a crash which happens when adding a layout to a gui scene.
