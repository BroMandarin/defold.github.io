## Engine
__CHANGE__: ([#7234](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7234)) __Introduce VertexStreamDeclaration concept__ 
Removed dmGraphics::VertexElement from dmSdk in favor of new API functions to create vertex declarations from.

__NEW__: ([#7196](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7196)) __Create atlas resource in runtime__ 
Added new function *resource.create_atlas(path, args)* to create an atlas resource in runtime. The resource is almost the same as an atlas generated during build time except for a few caveats. Please consult the API reference for how to use this feature.

__NEW__: ([#7206](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7206)) __resource.set_texture transcode support__ 
Added support for setting compressed and transcoded texture data in the resource.set_texture function. This can be used to decrease the runtime memory for dynamically created texture resources. The function now accepts binary data from .basis files and will pick a compressed GPU format for the client platform.

__NEW__: ([#7093](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7093)) __Added mesh frustum culling__ 
Frustum culling support for mesh component (sphere algorithm)

__NEW__: ([#5989](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/5989)) __Improved on the error message when reaching the max number of possible draw calls__ 


__FIX__: ([#7244](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7244)) __Conform 'buffer is full' error messages__ 
When a component cannot be created we show an error message on where in the project that can be modified, but previously the messages had different wording. This change tries to conform most of these cases into the same format.

__FIX__: ([#7171](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7171)) __Fix crash when max sound instances is 0__ 
Fixed a crash when max sound instances is 0 in game.project

__FIX__: ([#7251](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7251)) __Make sure to invert initial mouse y position on macOS__ 
The initial mouse y position on macOS uses inverted y coordinates with 0 starting at the top of the screen. This fix inverts the y position of the initial mouse position.

__FIX__: ([#7257](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7257)) __Fix issues with missing default values when getting config values__ 
The recently added functionality to get config values as strings, ints and numbers takes an optional second argument as the default value if the config value does not exist. In the case of getting an int or a number the code incorrectly required a default value or nil, but not the complete lack of a second argument. In addition to this the API reference also states that in the absence of a default value that nil should be returned when in fact a 0 is returned. Both of these issues are now fixed and it is now possible to call the function without a second argument, in which case 0 is returned if the config value doesn't exist.

Assuming a game.project with the following:

```
[test]
foo = 123
```

```lua
print(sys.get_config_int("test.foo")) --123
print(sys.get_config_int("test.bar")) -- 0
print(sys.get_config_int("test.bar", 345)) -- 345
print(sys.get_config_number("test.foo")) --123
print(sys.get_config_number("test.bar")) -- 0
print(sys.get_config_number("test.bar", 345.5)) -- 345.5
```

__FIX__: ([#7259](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7259)) __Vulkan bugfixes__ 
Fixed two issues with the Vulkan renderer:
* Set binding base 1 for shader bindings (uniforms & samplers) - this means that we can detect unused bindings and still produce valid spir-v which previously did not work
* Clearing render targets (also applies to backbuffer) always cleared color buffers as well, the clear flags should now be respected

__FIX__: ([#6977](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/6977)) __Track in profiler if thread was attached to JVM and wasn't detached__ 
It detects only cases when thread attached and wasn't detached between frames. 

__FIX__: ([#7260](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7260)) __Get CPU usage on Android 8+ devices__ 
Alternative CPU usage algorithm for android 8+. Fixes profiler.get_cpu_usage report as 0 on late android versions.


## Editor
__CHANGE__: ([#7250](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7250)) __Use uniform scale for the particle fx in gui__ 
The editor preview of particle effects in gui scenes did not show an accurate representation of the particle effect at runtime. After some investigation it turns out that it was in fact the runtime which was inaccurate and picked the x component of the scale at all times instead of the minimum scale value from a non-uniform scale. This means that a particle effect with scale [5.0 1.0 1.0] used scale 5.0 while a pfx with scale [1.0 5.0 1.0] used scale 1.0. The correct scale should be 1.0 in both cases since the smallest scale value should always be chosen.

This is likely a regression from a change introduced in [#2540](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/2540) back in 2018. This is now fixed and particle effects both on game objects and in gui scenes will use the uniform minimum scale value in both the editor and engine.

__FIX__: ([#7265](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7265)) __Use alpha propagation in GUI text nodes__ 
Bugfix for GUI text nodes in editor when using inherit-alpha.

__FIX__: ([#7252](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7252)) __Do not run build hooks when attaching debugger or hot-reloading__ 
The pre- and post-build hooks were incorrectly run also when attaching the debugger and hot-reloading resources. This fix only runs the pre- and post-build hooks when building the project using the "Project->Build" and "Debug->Start with debugger" options.

__FIX__: ([#7200](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7200)) __Make the search for resource links more efficient__ 
On big projects with a lot of resources, it might take a lot of time to show output in the console because for every potential resource link we have to filter through all tracked resources. We now try to be smarter about it, both by limiting the candidates for search only to ellipsis-prefixed ones and by building a suffix map for the added lines batch so we have to go through all the resources less frequently.

__FIX__: ([#7112](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7112)) __Non-editable resource variants__ 
Added a **Non-editable Directories** field to **Shared Editor Settings**. After a restart, resources below these directories will be loaded in a non-editable mode that will be more efficient to load and manage, at the cost of not being editable. In addition, these resources will not be overwritten when saving in the editor.

**Known limitations**
* It is not possible to override properties on objects inside non-editable collections or game objects from an editable collection.

__FIX__: ([#7254](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7254)) __Increase connection timeout during update__ 
The editor update sometimes fails due to connection timeouts when the update is downloaded on a slow or low quality network. This change increases the connection timeout to 5000ms and the read timeout to 10000ms.

__FIX__: ([#7262](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7262)) __Show informative error message on cyclic resource dependencies__ 
Cyclic resource dependencies in the editor did not show a user friendly error message. The message did in fact seem to indicate an error with the editor rather than with the project structure. This change detect cyclic dependencies and shows a popup with an improved error message to clearly indicate the problem to the developer.
