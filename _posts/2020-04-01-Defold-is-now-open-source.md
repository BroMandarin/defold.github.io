We are happy to announce that as of April 2020 Defold, the ultimate game engine for web and mobile, is available as an open source project! This move will bring transparency to the development process and invite external contributors to make the engine better for everyone.

As part of the open source process, King has decided to transfer Defold to a software foundation; the Defold Foundation. This will further strengthen Defold as an open source project and establish the future of Defold in the hands of the Defold Foundation together with the community.

“We are immensely proud to be able to open source Defold and thrilled about the journey as an open source game engine together with our great community of Defold developers. We would also wish to thank King for believing in our vision and entrusting Defold to the Defold Foundation.” says Björn Ritzl, Product Owner, the Defold Foundation.
