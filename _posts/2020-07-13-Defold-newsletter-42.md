Hello, Defolder! ðŸ‘‹

This week we have several new games to share and an update on Web Monetization in games made with Defold. We also have the latest Defold beta release notes.

## Games
### Juump!
Forum user Totebo released Juump! last week in collaboration with Winkel Games.

_"JUUMP is a fast-paced, endless arcade climber. Super quick to learn but highly rewarding to master. Jump, slide and dodge through a dangerous world. How far can you get?"_

[INSTALL](https://forum.defold.com/t/juump/65743)

### Hyper Dash
_"Hyper Dash is a simple hyper-casual game where you need to aim carefully and dash back and forth between the colored walls."_

[PLAY](https://shapeshiftjm.itch.io/hyper-dash)

### Librarian Barbarians
Forum user Klear made this fighting game about him and his colleagues at the Municipal Library of Prague. You better not be late returning books unless you're willing to risk your life against BohouÅ¡, LukÃ¡Å¡ and the other bad-ass librarians!

### Brain Please Don't
Critique Gaming (developers of Interrogation) created "Brain Please Don't", a game about mental health, at the last Global Game Jam. The game has now been released on Steam.

_"Brain Please Donâ€™t lets you try Cameronâ€™s week with various different versions of the teenager, and each choice made along the way changes Cameronâ€™s inner universe, and the deck that represents it."_

## Web Monetization update
The Defold Foundation was [awarded a grant from Grant for the Web](https://defold.com/2020/06/09/Defold-is-awarded-a-grant-from-Grant-for-the-Web/) on the 9th of June. The Defold Foundation will use the grant to integrate, promote and support the use of Web Monetization in web games created using Defold.

The first milestone of the project has been reached with the launch of the Web Monetization extension, template project and new manual. With the help of the new [Web Monetization manual and the extension](https://defold.com/manuals/web-monetization/) developers can now get started with Web Monetization in Defold games.

Next milestone is the release of a sample game and the announcement of the web monetization game jam.
