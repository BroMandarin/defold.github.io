STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN - May 19, 2020 - Mobile games company King today announced that the Defold game engine is available as a free and open project. As part of this process King has transferred Defold to a software foundation; the Defold Foundation. The Defold Foundation has taken full ownership of the Defold product and services, including the website, build servers, user forum and social media channels. The source code is available on GitHub.

“We are immensely proud to be able to make the Defold source code available and open to contributions. We’re eager to start the journey as a free and open game engine together with our great community of game developers building games using Defold. We would also wish to thank King for believing in our vision and entrusting Defold to the Defold Foundation.” says Björn Ritzl, Product Owner, the Defold Foundation.

Developers from the original development team will leave King to work full time on Defold on behalf of the Defold Foundation. The foundation will work closely with the developer community and industry partners to drive new development in 2020 and beyond.

The Defold Foundation board will be headed by Sara Cederberg (King) and include industry profiles such as Elin Eriksson (Women in Tech Sweden).

“We’re hugely impressed by the Defold team, and look forward to seeing many great gaming experiences come to life. We’ve seen millions of players already playing the King games run on the Defold engine and we’re excited to see the community come together even more, with the support of the Defold Foundation.” says Tjodolf Sommestad, Chief Development Officer, King.
