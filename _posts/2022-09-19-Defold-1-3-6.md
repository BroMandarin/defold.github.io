## Engine
__NEW__: ([#3614](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/3614)) Add matrix user constant type

It is now possible to set matrix constants in materials via go.set or render.constant buffers:

    local buffer = render.constant_buffer()
    buffer.ny_matrix = vmath.matrix4()

__NEW__: ([#6529](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6529)) Add array support for constant buffers in render scripts

Constant buffers supports setting array values by using tables:

    local buffer = render.constant_buffer()
    -- in-line
    buffer.my_array = { vmath.vector4(), vmath.vector4() }
    -- as elements
    buffer.my_array = {}
    buffer.my_array[1] = vmath.vector4()

__NEW__: ([#6155](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6155)) Add anisotropic filtering support for material samplers

Material sampler slots now have a new field called `max_anisotropy` that you can use to set the level of anisotropic filtering for specific shader samplets. The max value is determined by the device driver and will be capped to the max value if a higher value has been provided.


__NEW__: ([#6532](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6532)) __Add more descriptive error message to sys.save__ 
If a `sys.save()` operation fails the error message will now contain additional information about the reason.

This PR adds a new function in `dstrings.h` (`dmStrError`) that translates and copies errno values to a buffer for printing human readable error messages.

__NEW__: ([#6676](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6676)) __Increase table serialization limits__ 
It is now possible to serialize Lua tables with more than 65535 keys (new max is 2^32). The previous maximum size of 512kb for the serialized table has been removed and dynamic memory allocation will be used for tables larger than 512kb.

Note: The save file format has changed which means that a file saved with 1.3.6 is not compatible with older versions of Defold.

__NEW__: ([#6872](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6872)) __Change profiler layout for representation in runtime__ 
Fix issue when many property values rendered out of screen in the runtime profiler.

__NEW__: ([#6828](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6828)) __Center view on camera__ 
Added an option on the camera component to toggle from the default perspective projection to an orthographic projection. When a camera component is in orthographic projection mode it will automatically center on the position of the game object the camera belongs to.

A new `orthographic_zoom` property has also been added to the camera component to change the zoom level when using the orthographic projection. This can be used either as a fixed zoom or from a script to set a variable zoom level based on window dimensions.

These changes are compatible with the existing default render script. To use both the view and projection from the camera the developer must send a `use_camera_projection` message to the render script. The camera and render documentation need to be changed to reflect these changes.

__FIX__: ([#6945](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6945)) __Added raw gamepad input to gui scripts__ 
Raw gamepad events were previously only sent to script components. This fix adds raw gamepad input events to gui scripts as well.

__FIX__: ([#6224](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6224)) __Added particle initial stretch values to emitter template__ 
This fix adds missing values to the particle emitter template used by the editor when adding an emitter to a particlefx.

__FIX__: ([#6818](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6818)) __Luajit updated LuaJIT to version 633f265__ 


__FIX__: ([#6925](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/6925)) __Show options when there are multiple candidates for a partial console path__ 
When multiple project resources match a partial file path in the Console, we now present a choice of resources to open.

__FIX__: ([#6871](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6871)) __Updated Remotery 1.2.1__ 
This change updates the Remotery profiler to version 1.2.1. The new version contains bug fixes and performance improvements.

__FIX__: ([#6883](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6883)) __Fix rare crash in profiler__ 
Make sure that profiler doesn't crash if Lua doesn't provide information about function source.

__FIX__: ([#6898](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6898)) __Byte code errors in multi-architecture builds run on a 32-bit device__ 
The 32- and 64-bit byte code delta used to patch 64-bit byte code for 32-bit devices was sometime calculated incorrectly such that the written byte code became invalid. This could be observed when bundling for both 32-bit and 64-bit and running the build on a 32-bit device (Android)

__FIX__: ([#6613](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6613)) __Fix issue when backspace holding doesn't work on iOS__ 
This fix makes it possible to remove multiple symbols if a user holds `backspace` button instead of a single tap - a single character removing.

__FIX__: ([#6764](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6764)) __Make it possible to avoid filling `device_ident` value__ 
Fixed issue when `GetSystemInfo()` (the method used internally and for `sys.get_sys_info()`) by default requests `device_ident `. On Android this is `android_id` - a value secured by OS. If an application requests this then Data Safety Section needs to be filled even if app doesn't use internet connection and any IDs at all.
If you don't need `device_ident` value just call `sys.get_sys_info()` function with `{ignore_secure = true}` parameter: `sys.get_sys_info({ignore_secure  = true})`

__FIX__: ([#6531](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6531)) __Don't automatically enable all extensions on WebGL__ 


__FIX__: ([#6858](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/6858)) __Prevent situations when app hangs in infinite loop instead of crash on MacOS__ 
Fixes a rare situations when application hangs in infinite loop instead of crash on MacOS.

__FIX__: ([#6597](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6597)) __Fix crash in some cases when count of labels more than `label.max_count`__ 
Fixes crash that reproduces with the following conditions:
- objects spawned by a collection factory;
- objects has a parent-child hierarchy;
- the parent object has a component that can't be spawned because of max components limit.

__FIX__: ([#3400](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/3400)) __Update iconexe and defold icon with a bigger size__ 
The problem was that the IconExe class doesn't add any icons, it just replaces the ones that exist. Our default icon was previously 128x128 as max resolution, this PR replaced it with a log thats 256x256.

This PR also updates our IconExe.java to the newest version from latest SWT master.

__FIX__: ([#6847](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/6847)) __Use `--verify-graphics-calls=false` by default for HTML5__ 
Verifying of the graphics calls in html5 build maybe useful for debug reason, but it's may be very slow on some browsers. This fix makes `--verify-graphics-calls=false` the option by default to make build faster even in debug. But if you have any graphics related issues in your buld while testing, remove this argument or change it to `--verify-graphics-calls=true` to have more information what's going on.

__FIX__: ([#5727](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/5727)) __Fix issue with force using of landscape mode in iOS games on macOS with M1__ 
Fixed issue when iOS game installed on M1 Mac forces to use landscape mode even if game made in portrait mode.


## Editor
__NEW__: ([#3981](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/3981)) __Expose sprite scaling in the editor__ 
The sprite component has a scale but it has not been possible to modify it from the editor. The sprite scale could only be change at runtime using `go.set("#sprite", "scale", vmath.vector3())`. This change adds a scale property to the sprite component, next to the already existing position and rotation properties.

__NEW__: ([#6786](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6786)) __Use label as tooltip text for unknown settings__ 
This allows viewing the full name of a setting in a tooltip when it does not fit in its place.

__FIX__: ([#6885](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6885)) __Fix Lua breakpoints not hitting unless bytecode is embedded__ 
Fixed Lua debugger breakpoints not suspending execution when running from the editor or bundling with the `--use-lua-source` flag.

__FIX__: ([#6399](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6399)) __Retain specific expensive outputs in editor cache__ 
* Reduced the time spent on subsequent Build and Save operations when editing a large project.
* Added a Shared Editor Settings editor to the Project menu where projects can adjust the cache size used by the editor for all users working in the project. If you still experience frequent delays in the editor after this change, try increasing the cache size.

__FIX__: ([#6806](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6806)) __IDE: Unsorted order of assets__ 
Fixed sorting.

__FIX__: ([#6796](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6796)) __Profiler is sometimes unresponsive__ 
Added a `profiler.sleep_between_server_updates` *game.project* setting to set the delay in milliseconds between profiler server updates. Try changing this value to something like 50ms if you have problems with the computer becoming unresponsive while using the profiler.

The profiler will now also reuse any existing profiler port when reconnecting. This should solve reported issues with profiler connection problems.

__FIX__: ([#6388](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6388)) __Skip engine build when running on a remote target__ 


__FIX__: ([#6678](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/6678)) __Fix shift+click selection in select list dialog__ 
This changeset instructs ListViewBehavior to not set the anchor for shift-selection to the end of a list when we change list items by typing into filter text field.
