_The Defold Foundation is inviting web game developers across the world to join a month long Web Monetization game jam, starting on the 1st of November._

STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN - Sep. 29, 2020 - The Defold Foundation today announced that it is inviting web game developers across the world to join a month long Web Monetization game jam, starting on the 1st of November. Developers will be challenged to create a themed web game showing their creative and developer skills as well as a good use of Web Monetization in their games. The proud winner and runner-ups will receive cash prizes, merchandise and other benefits, as well as bragging rights!

“Earlier this year the Defold Foundation was awarded a grant from Grant for the Web to explore the use of Web Monetization in games. This game jam is an important part of the research and exploration we are doing this year to learn more about how Web Monetization can be used as a new way for game developers to monetize their creations,” said Defold Product Owner Björn Ritzl.

The game jam will be hosted on the popular game jam and indie games website itch.io. Join the jam through the [official game jam page on itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/the-web-monetization-challenge-2020). The submitted games will be judged by a panel of judges consisting of prominent members of the video game and tech industry.

##### About Web Monetization
[Web Monetization is a proposed API standard](https://webmonetization.org/) that allows websites to request a stream of very small payments (e.g. fractions of a cent) from a user. In exchange for payments from the user, websites can provide the user with a "premium" experience, such as allowing access to exclusive content, removing advertising, or even removing the need to log in to access content or services.

##### About Defold Foundation
[The Defold Foundation](https://defold.com/foundation/) is the owner of the free to use, developer-friendly and source available game engine Defold. The foundation works together with industry partners to provide free and open software and services to game developers across the globe. The foundation was created in May 2020 and is registered in Stockholm, Sweden.
