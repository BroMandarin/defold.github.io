				<p>The Defold Foundation is registered in Sweden under the name "Stiftelsen Defold Foundation". The foundation is governed by Swedish law and overseen by the County Administrative Board in Stockholm. The foundation board consists of representatives from King, the Defold team and the industry.</p>
