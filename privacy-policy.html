<p>Legal Bases</p>
<p>In each case where we process your information, we do so lawfully in accordance with one of the legal basis set out
    under European data protection law. The legal bases which we rely upon are the following:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Contractual Necessity.</strong> This covers data used by us in order to provide you with Services
    that you have requested - and that we have agreed - to provide to you, such as the Defold Software, the Website
    and/or the Player Analytics feature;</li>
<li><strong>Legal Obligation.</strong> This covers data used by us to comply with a legal obligation, such as the
    prevention of crime or fraud;</li>
<li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> This covers data used by us for purposes that are not harmful to your
    privacy and can be reasonably expected within the context of your use of our Services, such as analytics and
    research, marketing and promotion and optimisation of our Services; and</li>
<li><strong>Consent.</strong> Where we ask for your consent to use your data for a particular purpose, we will
    make this clear at the point of collection and we will also make clear how you can withdraw your consent.</li></ul>
<p><strong>8. Will we share your data with third parties?</strong></p>
<p>We will only share your data with third parties:</p>
<ul><li>with your consent (including as set out in this Services Privacy Policy);</li>
<li>as is reasonably necessary in order to provide the Services to you (for example, by providing information
    about you to suppliers we may use to fulfil the Services or to communicate with you);</li>
<li>where your data is on an anonymous and aggregated basis, meaning an individual user could not be personally
    identified from it;</li>
<li>when you interact with our social media channels (for example, by providing a testimonial about one of our
    Services) we may publish the information submitted, alongside your name and home country on our websites and social
    media channels;</li>
<li>as we reasonably believe is permitted by law or regulation;</li>
<li>in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions and/or
    any other agreement with you; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of King, our users, or others; or</li>
<li>in the event that there is a sale of the assets of our company or Midasplayer Technology AB or corporate
    restructuring, or as a result of a change of control of our company or one of its group companies (including
    Midasplayer Technology AB), or in preparation of any of these events. Any third party to which we transfer or sell
    our assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information you provide to us in the manner
    set out in this Services Privacy Policy. We will not sell or rent your information to any third party outside of
    these circumstances.</li></ul>
<p>We may also share your information with our service providers if necessary to enable them to provide services to
    us.</p>
<p><strong>9. Interaction with third party social networks or platforms</strong><br>
    <br>
    When you bundle your Game you may allow it to interact with a third party social network or platform provider, such
    as Facebook or Google. These applications or websites are created and maintained by a third party that is not a part
    of, or controlled by King. You should ensure that you read their terms of service and privacy policies to understand
    how they treat your data and your Players’ data.</p>
<p>You understand that we will not have access to any data you or your Players choose to share with such third party
    social network or platform provider.</p>
<p><strong>10. For how long will we retain your information?</strong></p>
<p>We will retain information collected about you for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was
    collected or as needed to provide you with Services. We may retain this information after you have closed any
    account you have with us or after we have ceased providing Services to you if retention of your information is
    reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes between
    members, prevent fraud, cheating or abuse, or enforce this Services Privacy Policy or any other agreement we may
    have with a user.</p>
<p><strong>11. Will we transfer your information overseas?</strong></p>
<p>Information may be transferred to, and stored at, a jurisdiction/country outside the European Economic Area
    ("<strong>EEA</strong>"), which may not have the same level of privacy protection. It may also be processed by staff
    operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. We will take all steps reasonably necessary
    to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Services Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>12. How do we protect your information?</strong></p>
<p>The security of your information is important to us. We maintain appropriate technical and physical safeguards to
    protect your information against accidental or unlawful destruction or loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or
    access, use and all other unlawful forms of processing of the data in our possession. However, since the internet is
    not a completely secure environment we cannot guarantee that information you transmit or store via your use of the
    Website or our Services will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of our
    safeguards.</p>
<p><strong>13. Links from our Services</strong></p>
<p>We may provide links to third party websites from our Services. You understand that when you click on these links any
    data which you provide thereafter is subject to such third party's privacy policy and not to ours. Although we will
    endeavour only to link to reputable websites, we take no responsibility for the content, safety or security of any
    third party website.</p>
<p><strong>14. Your rights in relation to your information</strong></p>

        know that you wish to exercise your right of access and what information in particular you would like to
        receive. We reserve the right to ask for reasonable evidence to verify your identity before we provide you with
        any information. Please note that we may not be able to provide all the information you ask for, for instance if
        the information includes personal information about another person. Where we are not able to provide you with
        information that you have asked for, we will endeavour to tell you why. We will try to respond to any request
        for a right of access as soon as possible, but we will always do so within 1 month of receipt of your request

        will correct it as soon as we can.
    </li>

        that we hold about you deleted. Should you wish to have any information about you deleted, please log in to your
        Defold account, and proceed to delete your account under your user settings. Where we delete personal
        information about you, we may still retain some or all of that information for other purposes such as
        maintaining financial records, protecting or enforcing legal rights, maintaining marketing suppression lists or
        for technical reasons such as maintaining technical security or our database integrity. We may also retain your
        information in an anonymised form. Please note that where any third party copies information which you have made
        available via the use of our Services (for example, a collaborator that you allow to interact with you on one of
        your Projects), we may not be able to amend or delete it because it may not be in our control.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data portability</strong>. In some circumstances, you may have the right to request that data which you
        have provided to us is provided to you, so you can transfer this to another data controller.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Restriction of processing</strong>. In some cases, you may have the right to request a restriction of
        the processing of your personal data, such as when you are disputing the accuracy of your data held by us.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Right to object</strong>. You have the right to object to the processing of personal data about you
        which is processed on the grounds of legitimate interests (see Legal Bases above).

        us, you can change your mind at any time by following the opt out link in any marketing communication that is
