### What is Defold?
Defold is a free and open-source game engine used for development of desktop, mobile and web games. The Defold editor runs on Windows, Linux and macOS and it includes a code editor, debugger, profiler and advanced scene and UI editors. Game logic is written in Lua with the option to use native code to extend the engine with additional functionality. Defold is used by a growing number of developers to create commercial hits as well as games for game jams and in schools to teach game development. Defold is known for its ease of use and it is praised for its technical documentation and friendly community of developers.

### History
Defold was created by Christian Murray and Ragnar Svensson as a side-project while they were working at Avalanche Studios, and later as a full time business before being acquired by [King](https://www.king.com) in 2014. Defold was developed and used internally at King for a few years before the decision was made to make Defold available to developers outside of King. The announcement and release of Defold as a free to use game engine was made at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco in March 2016. Development has continued with bi-weekly incremental releases of the engine and editor, with a major milestone being the release of the new editor in 2017.

### Open source
King made the decision to [open source Defold](/opensource) in May 2020, and as part of the open source process, transfer Defold to a software foundation; the [Defold Foundation](/foundation). The foundation works together with industry partners to provide open source software and services to game developers across the globe.
