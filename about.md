### Defold
Defold is a cross platform game engine supporting desktop, mobile and web development. The Defold editor is also cross platform (Windows, Linux and macOS) and it includes a code editor, debugger, profiler and advanced scene and UI editors. Game logic is written in Lua with the option to use native code to extend the engine with additional functionality. Defold has a zero-setup policy where no additional tools or configurations are required to use Defold. Developers can produce application bundles for all supported platforms without any additional build tools.

### History
Defold was initially developed as a side-project and later as a full time business by Christian Murray and Ragnar Svensson before being acquired by [King](https://www.king.com) in 2014. Defold was developed and used internally at King for a few years before the decision was made to make Defold available to developers outside of King. The announcement and release of Defold as a free to use game engine was made at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco in March 2016. 	Development has continued with bi-weekly incremental releases of the engine and editor, with a major milestone being the release of the new editor in 2017.

In April 2020 King decided to [open source Defold](/opensource), and as part of the open source process, transfer Defold to a software foundation; the [Defold Foundation](/foundation).
