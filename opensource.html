				<h3>The Road to Open Source</h3>
				<p>
				The Defold team members are all huge fans of open source development and we have planned to open source Defold ever since it was made available as a free, albeit closed source, product in 2016. The first step was to make libraries, samples, templates and documentation available as open source and ever since the launch of the native extension system all extensions made for Defold have also been made available as open source. The final step before open sourcing the engine and editor was taken when several of the previously engine integrated extensions were moved to native extensions to slim down the engine core and make it easier to contribute to. Defold was finally open sourced in November of 2019. We are immensly proud of this achievement and we are thrilled to continue our journey as an open source game engine together with our great community of Defold developers.

				<h5>The Defold Foundation</h5>
				<p>
				At the same time as Defold became an open source product the brand, site and source code was donated to a software foundation, The Defold Foundation. The foundation is responsible for the continued development of Defold as well as the availability of services such as the forum and native extension build server.
