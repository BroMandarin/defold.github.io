				<p>Ever since King and the Defold team decided to make Defold available as a free to use game engine in 2016 it has been a goal of ours to also open source Defold. We are happy to announce that as of December 2019 Defold is available as an open source project! We believe this move will bring transparency to the development process and invite external contributors to make the engine better for everyone.</p>

				<p>As part of the open source process, King and the Defold team have decided to donate Defold to a software foundation; the Defold Foundation. This will further strengthen Defold as an open source project and establishes the future of Defold in the hands of the Defold Foundation together with the community.</p>

				<p><i>“We are immensely proud to finally be able to open source Defold and thrilled about the journey as an open source game engine together with our great community of Defold developers. We would also wish to thank King for believing in our vision and entrusting Defold to the foundation”</i> says Björn Ritzl, Defold product owner.</p>
