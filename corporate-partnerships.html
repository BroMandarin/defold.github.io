<h3>Why we seek corporate partnerships</h3>
<p>As a software foundation we rely on corporate partnerships to ensure the long term sustainability of the project. The funds received from corporate partnerships are used for:</p>

<ul class="checkmark">
	<li>Hiring developers to work on Defold</li>
	<li>Pay for hosting of services</li>
	<li>Purchase of hardware for testing and development</li>
	<li>Pay for travel expenses when visiting conferences</li>
</ul>

<h3>Corporate partnership</h3>
<p>The corporate partnership is available to corporations and organizations who want the option to fund development of specific functionality. As a part of the corporate partnership you will receive dedicated development time from the Defold Team and we will work with you to define which projects to work on.</p>

<p>In addition to this, corporate partners can get prominent mentions on the Defold site, in newsletters and in the Defold editor. Corporate partners will also get invitations to participate at special events hosted by the foundation.</p>

<p>We offer the following levels of corporate partnership:</p>
