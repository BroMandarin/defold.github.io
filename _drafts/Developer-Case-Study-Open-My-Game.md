One would think that the long and agonizing death of Flash spelled the end for games played in the browser and that the heyday of browser games was long gone. Fortunately this couldn't be further from the truth!

Browser games have seen a tremendous growth thanks to the technological advances made by browser vendors. JavaScript is blazingly fast nowadays and Flash has been replaced by modern web technologies adopted by all major browsers. This new set of standardised browser APIs are often referred to as HTML5. The HTML5 APIs have support for hardware accelerated graphics, low-latency sound playback, gamepads and the ability to play games in fullscreen.

In parallel with the advancements done in the browser we have also seen more and more game engines, especially those focusing on cross platform game development, adopting new technology to create highly optimized games for the web.

We are also seeing a strong movement to democratize game development and make it available to developers across the globe. With the ubiquity of browsers it is no surprise that open source HTML5 game engines such as Phaser and Pico-8 are in the forefront together with a few cross platform game engines also operating in the open source space.

Finally, let's not forget about the players! Numbers show that players are playing browser games like never before on a growing selection of popular game portals offering high quality games as well as quirky and fun games made during game jams.

In this developer case study we'll take a look at how Belarusian game developer OpenMyGame are using the cross platform and source available Defold game engine to create web games on Yandex.Games, one of the leading platforms for high quality web games. We reached out to Vladimir Timoshkov, CEO at OpenMyGame, to learn more.


**Björn**: Vladmir, can you tell us about the history of OpenMyGame and the games you are making?

**Vladmir**: Three mobile developers, who were a team on programming contests ACM ICPC during University, desired to make their own projects. Games - our passion to play and are not boring and challenging to code, which was also a decisive factor for us.

In 2011 there was a rise of mobiles and we found it as a good opportunity to try. We made about 20 single screen puzzle games in a year just for fun. We used Andengine and published them on Android Market (the olds remember this name). We earned first money from ads, but it wasn't enough to leave our full-time jobs.

Market was shifting to games of better quality and we supported this wave and in 2012 developed the most challenging game for our team Draw & Guess Online. It is native Android, native iOS, native web and big server side on Java. And still it was just a hobby for three guys having full-time jobs not connected with gamedev.

For 3 following years 2012-2015 we struggled with our attempt to make our game earn enough money. It took a lot of efforts in game design and the business part of gamedev. Because we had no funds we needed to make the game to perform.

In early 2016 we decided to quit our jobs just because we got tired of saying ourselves “I have no time”. We just wanted to check our lottery ticket - are we able to be profitable on the market where we have so much experience if we can use all our energy and time? The answer was found in three months. And it was yes, luckily.

We are developing games for a casual audience which wants to use some mind effort to play - word games, quizzes, puzzles.


**Björn**: When did you first hear of Defold?

**Vladimir**: I met Alexey Gulev at a local gamedev event in Belarus in 2018. We found a lot in common to talk about and one of the topics was game engines. He told me that he was playing with a new engine from King and described the advantages of Defold against Unity (one of our main development tools still now). So it was a kind of debate, where I was mostly on the Unity side because of business reasons - hiring, community, plugins. Important notice - we were talking only about mobiles.  


**Björn**: What made you choose Defold for some of the games your studio is working on?

**Vladmir**: I was following Alexey's updates on twitter and was a witness to his pioneering of Defold. His regular updates were refreshing and upvoting knowledge about Defold in my everyday context.

So when in 2019 we decided to port our top game Sea of Words to the new platform Facebook Instant, we chose Defold undoubtedly because of strong HTML5 support.
Soon a skillful engineer joined our team. He had a huge experience in several engines (but not Defold) and in three months the game was ported.

We can surely say that the basics of Defold can be picked up very easily if a developer has made at least one game before.

But the outcome on Facebook was negative, we didn't succeed in getting organic traffic and paid users were far away from payback level, but despite that we gained experience and had a game ready to be published elsewhere on the web.

That's how we bumped into Yandex.Games.


**Björn**: Can you tell us about your experience releasing games on Yandex Games?

**Vladmir**: Sure. After getting a lemon (fail on Facebook) we tried to make a lemonade (publishing on other html5 platforms). We had several options: russian big social networks OK and VK. Publishing on both of them is not an easy step because you are supposed to have a server for user data and payments. Also you have to put your game on your static server.

We started dealing with that and randomly I found that there was a young but promising platform Yandex.Games. It took us 2 weeks to support API and the game was there, because user data storage and game hosting is a part of platform responsibility.

And it boomed.

The game has reached top-5 on the platform by downloads. Our first and all the following games received the editor's choice badge.


**Björn**: Yandex Games offers several monetization options. What is your monetization strategy for the games you release?

**Vladmir**: For now Yandex.Games supports in-app purchases and a good inventory of ads (banner, interstitials, rewarded). We support both ads and IAPs, but advertisement is the most important for us just because of the genre we are in.

**Björn**: I've heard that you have a serious approach to hiring with your own internal game developer academy. Can you tell us about your hiring process to find new promising talent?

**Vladmir**: Yes, we faced a problem of hiring Defold developers, there are not so many of them, and the biggest part of them are indie developers who want to make their own games and don't want to be hired or can't pass our technical interview.

So we started an internship program in our city with a quite sophisticated approach.

At first we send a questionnaire of five small functions to code in any language. If it is done correctly we have an interview to check tech skills more deeply. Then we invite top-3 applicants to a 2-month internship.

First two weeks students solve algorithmic problems chosen from hackerrank. Because it is very important for us to produce efficient code and encourage developers to think about performance.

Next two weeks are for the first project on Defold, we use Fruit Ninja gameplay as a base. Main goal - to make the complete project with a new tool.
And the last month is for a “diploma” project, where we pay much attention to project structure, OOP, and extendability.


**Björn**: Are you currently hiring?

**Vladmir**: Yes, and we hire remotely, so feel free to contact us.


**Björn**: What are your predictions for the next few years when it comes to browser based games?


**Vladmir**: The future is bright at least for our niche - smart casual games. I think just a little more integration is needed from mobile operating systems to put an icon on the screen, support notifications and other platform specific features.


**Björn**: Thank you! How can the community follow the progress of OpenMyGame to learn of new games and developments?


**Vladmir**: Thank you very much for the talk.
