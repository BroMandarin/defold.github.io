In recent blogs post we've shown how developers are using Defold to create great games for platforms such as itch.io, [Game Distribution](https://gamedistribution.com/), [Poki](https://poki.com/) and [Yandex.Games](https://yandex.com/games/). These success stories are really encouraging and they are proof that web games is a serious business. Powerful game engines and modern browser technology enables developers to create amazing games that can be experienced both at home on your PC and from your mobile phone while you are one the move. And thanks to the web game platforms the games can be easily discovered and played by millions of players every day.

With most of the technical and distribution challenges solved, all that remains is to create a fun game and turn it into a profitable one. Easy right? How to create a fun game is obviously a big challenge in itself and it warrants a blog post of its own, but almost equally difficult is how to effectively monetize a game. These challenges obviously go hand in hand; It is difficult to monetize a game that isn't fun since players are unlikely to come back for more, but having a fun game doesn't necessarily make it a profitable unless you have a good grip on how to monetize your players.

In this blog post we will try to shed some light on how to monetize HTML5 games. The focus will be on how to work with ad monetization but will also touch upon other ways in which HTML5 games can be monetized. To help us figure this out we've invited developers and platform providers to share their best tips on monetization. Let's start by figuring out what alternatives we have at our disposal.


#### What are the ways in which developers can monetize their games?

A:


Fantastic, there's a lot of choice! Now let's focus on ads and ask ourselves how often should ads be shown? You don't what to fill your game with ads and break apart the experience for the player by constant ad breaks, but you also don't want to be too conservative as you may miss out on good opportunities.


#### So how often should you show ads? And when?

A:

Excellent. Let's dig in and look at some different ad formats:


#### What are your best tips on how to use rewarded ads? When and how should they be used?

A:


#### Are banner ads effective in games? Or are interstitial and rewarded ads always preferred?

A:


Ok, now that we have learned some best practices on ad usage we should probably also look at this from a game developers perspective.

#### What are your thoughts on designing a game for ad monetization from the start versus adding monetization after the game is done? With the latter probably being quite common. Can both approaches work?

A:


Unless you have an exclusive deal with a platform provider you probably want to release your game on multiple platforms. And each platform has its own SDK to show ads.

#### How do you as a developer structure your game for release on multiple platforms and take into account the different SDKs for showing ads?

A:


#### Another interesting question is if certain game genres monetize better than others? And if so which ones?

A:

We're starting to get a good grasp on ads! What other options are out there if you wish to monetize web games? [Web Monetization](https://defold.com/extension-webmonetization/) is an interesting new technology where micro payments are passively streamed from your players as they play your game. Another alternative is In-App Purchases, which is the big cash cow on native mobile games.

#### Is In-App Purchases a viable alternative for web games?

A:


#### Thank you! Do you have any final parting advice before we wrap up this blog post?
