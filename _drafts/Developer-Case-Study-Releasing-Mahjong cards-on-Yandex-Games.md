Yandex.Games have quickly turned into one of the favorite places for Defold developers to release their HTML5 games. Yandex.Games has a large player base, an easy to integrate SDK and fast and smooth publishing and review process. In this blog post we'll look at the development process for Mahjong Cards, a game developed by Indiesoft Llc and launched on Yandex.Games a few months ago. We will also take a look at the Yandes.Games SDK integration created by Indiesoft and shared for free in the Defold Asset portal. We asked Artsiom Trubchyk, one of the founders of Indiesoft to help us out.


#### Artsiom, could you please tell us about yourself and the history of Indiesoft and the games you are making?

#### How did you first hear of Defold?

#### How many games have you released so far with Defold?

#### I believe that Mahjong Cards is the first game you have released on Yandex.Games? Could you tell us about the game?

#### What was the development process like for Mahjong Cards?

#### How was the experience of releasing a game on Yandex.Games?

#### You also shared your Yandex.Games SDK integration with the community. Why did you decide to share it with the Defold community?

#### What are you working on right now?

#### Thank you! How can the community follow your progress and learn of new games and developments?
