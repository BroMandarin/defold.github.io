### Introduction
The Defold Foundation was created by King in April 2020. The Defold Foundation is registered in Sweden under the name "Stiftelsen Defold Foundation" (org.no. 123456-7890). The foundation is governed by Swedish law and overseen by the County Administrative Board in Stockholm.

### Objectives
The objectives of the foundation are:

* Make the Defold software available to the public
* Make the Defold source code available to the public
* Support the open source community and the use of open licenses

### Vision
We believe in a free and open internet where software and services use open standards to bring net neutrality and democracy to everyone. The Defold Foundation will work together with industry partners to apply the same principles of free and open source software and service to the work we do with Defold.
