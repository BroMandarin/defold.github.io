**13. Your rights in relation to your information**

You have certain rights in connection with your personal information and how we handle it. You can exercise these rights at any time by contacting us via any of the methods set out in the How to Contact Us section below.

Those rights include:

 * **Right of access.** You have a right to know what information we hold about you and in some cases to have the information communicated to you. If you wish to exercise this right please contact us letting us know that you wish to exercise your right of access and what information in particular you would like to receive. We reserve the right to ask for reasonable evidence to verify your identity before we provide you with any information. Please note that we may not be able to provide all the information you ask for, for instance if the information includes personal information about another person. Where we are not able to provide you with information that you have asked for, we will endeavour to tell you why. We will try to respond to any request for a right of access as soon as possible, but we will always do so within 1 month of receipt of your request and verification of your identity.
 * **Right to correct personal information.** We try to keep the information that we hold about you accurate and up to date. Should you realise that any of the information that we hold about you is incorrect, please let us know by contacting us via any of the methods set out in the How to Contact Us section below and we will correct it as soon as we can.
 * **Data deletion.** In some circumstances you have a right to have some of the personal information that we hold about you deleted. Should you wish to have any information about you deleted, please log in to your Defold Community account, and proceed to delete your account under your user settings. Where we delete personal information about you, we may still retain some or all of that information for other purposes such as maintaining financial records, protecting or enforcing legal rights, maintaining marketing suppression lists or for technical reasons such as maintaining technical security or our database integrity. We may also retain your information in an anonymised form. Please note that where any third party copies information which you have made available via the use of our Services (for example, a collaborator that you allow to interact with you on one of your Projects), we may not be able to amend or delete it because it may not be in our control.
 * **Data portability.** In some circumstances, you may have the right to request that data which you have provided to us is provided to you, so you can transfer this to another data controller.
 * **Restriction of processing.** In some cases, you may have the right to request a restriction of the processing of your personal data, such as when you are disputing the accuracy of your data held by us.
 * **Right to object**. You have the right to object to the processing of personal data about you which is processed on the grounds of legitimate interests (see Legal Bases above).
 * **Direct marketing opt out.** If you have elected to receive direct marketing communications from us, you can change your mind at any time by following the opt out link in any marketing communication that is sent to you. It may take a few days for us to update our records before any opt out is effective.
